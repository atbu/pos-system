## pos-system

This is my A-Level Computer Science project, intended to be a point of sale system as used in restaurants and other similar places.

This was also my first time using such technologies as Next.js, React, Prisma, etc. so I learned as I went along and this proved to be a useful experience, although the code in its current state might not be of the highest quality due to the fact I was learning!
